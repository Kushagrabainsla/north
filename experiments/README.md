# North experiments

This directory stores reproducible evidence behind architecture decisions.
Each experiment owns its inputs, runnable harness, recorded results, limitations,
and the production decision those results informed. Product code may reuse the
same primitives, but it must not import recorded results.

## Experiments

- [`tool_selection/`](tool_selection/) — capability-catalog size and runtime
  tool-retrieval strategy.
